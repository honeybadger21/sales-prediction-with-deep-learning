# sales-prediction-with-deep-learning
Using Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting. Working with a daily historical sales data to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. 

Starting with time series data exploration, rearranging (shifting) the data to make it suitable for time series forecasting, using deep learning models (MLP, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) for modeling, comparing the models. 

Changes to come --> finding best parameters for the models used, diving into the predicted results with plots and graphs
